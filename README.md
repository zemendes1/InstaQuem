Before starting the installation, make sure that InstaQuem is compatible with your operating system. InstaQuem is only compatible with Windows. If you are using a different operating system, you will not be able to use InstaQuem.

1. Verify that Java JDK 19 is installed on your computer. If Java 19 is already installed, you can skip to step 7. If not, follow the instructions below to install it:
2. Visit the official JDK Java website ([https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk19-archive-downloads.html)).
3. On the download page, select the Windows x64 Installer option for Java SE Development Kit 19.0.1.
